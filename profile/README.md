# JuweL development

Hi there, I am here to share some ideas and concepts about development, tooling, and software architecture.

## Repository naming conventions

All repositories here start with a letter. The letter describes the purpose of the repository.

| letter | description|
|----|-----|
| B | backend |
| T | template |
| F | frontend |
| E | enviroment |
